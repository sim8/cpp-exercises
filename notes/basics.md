# Basics

- C++ is compiled
- `main()` is required
  - usually returns int
    - 0 means successful
    - No return means successful
    - Anything else - unsuccessful
- Not every OS uses return
- `<<` - "put to"
- `::` - found in namespace
  - Can make namespace visible (meaning it doesn't need to be specified again) by `using namespace std;`
- `import` is new to c++20
- Older and more reliable is `#include <iostream>`
- Initialization
  - `double d1 = 2.3;`
  - `double d1 {2.3};` universal form. Does not auto-convert types
- `auto` - can default to this type (deduces type)
- Namespaces
  - Local, class, namespace
  - Anything not in a block is global
- Objects are destroyed at the end of the scope
- Constants
  - `const` will not be changed after creation
    - `const` can be declared on function arg (very common)
  - `constexpr` evaluated at compile time (e.g. for value of pi)
    - Can be used before a function. C++ version of pure functions!
    - Can be used to eval constant + non-constant expressions
    - Can use `consteval` instead if you _only_ want constant results
    - Required in a few places such as
      - Array bounds
      - Case labels
      - Template value args
